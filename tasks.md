## Task 1: Open the `input.txt` file as `infile`
A sample input file named `input.txt` is provided as part of the project.
We need to open it to get a [file object](https://docs.python.org/3.7/glossary.html#term-file-object).

A preferred way to open a file with automatic resource cleanup is using the `with` statement, 
which is a control-flow structure with basic structure as:
```
with expression [as variable]:
    with-block
```

In above structure, use `open()` in the `expression`, and name the variable as `infile`.
